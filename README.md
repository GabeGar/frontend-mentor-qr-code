## My process

### Built with

-   Vite Build Tools
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-   Flexbox to center the qr container.
-   Utilizing non-static (px, ch, in), responsive css properties and units (ems/rems, min-height, max-width, etc).
-   Mobile first workflow to then transition into larger view ports.

### Useful resources

-   [Kevin Powell - CSS em and rem explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-aDOAMmDHI) - Assisted me in creating responsive padding, while readjusting the view port, within the chrome devtools. Kevin Powell is my goto resource for ANY and EVERYTHING CSS related.
